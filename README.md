This project aims to create a model to generate synthetic bond yield data, using a SEQGAN and Monte Carlo Rollouts to train the model.
# Still working on improving the performance of the model and its distribution hence the trained version of the model will be uploaded in due course.
We work on moving away from discrete tokens and using policy gradients for continuous actions.
