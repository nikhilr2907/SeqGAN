# Synthetic Bond Yield Data Generation

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a model that generates **synthetic bond yield data**.  
The approach combines **SEQGAN** with **Monte Carlo Rollouts** for training.

## Current Progress
- Working on improving model performance and the generated data distribution.  
- Model weights (post-training) will be uploaded in due course.

## Future Directions
- Transitioning away from **discrete tokens**.  
- Exploring **policy gradients** for continuous action spaces.
